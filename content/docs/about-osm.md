To maximize the re-usability of the data CycloFix collects, it was decided to use [OpenStreetMap](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM). But why? How does OSM help? You could say OSM is "the Wikipedia of maps". Anyone can improve our data. Anyone can re-use it â€” not necessarily through any official API, but through a whole ecosystem of tools and services that make the data available for a huge range of usecases.

We collected some resources that delve deeper into this topic:

- [How to switch to osm](https://switch2osm.org/)
- [Learn OSM](https://learnosm.org/)
- [20-page intro to OpenStreetMap](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Providing-data-to-OpenStreetMap.pdf), written with (local) governement in mind
- [a listing of projects where governements actively work with OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_for_Government)
- [you just want a free background map in Belgium?](https://openstreetmap.be/en/projects/belgium-baselayer.html)

CycloFix was built using [MapComplete](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete). That tool was invented to make it as easy as possible to harness the power of the crowd to generate detailed map data about any specific topic that [fits in OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/How_We_Map). Click below to read how we made that choice.
