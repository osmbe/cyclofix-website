## Using the data

Used all over the place; examples.

Downloadable: download.geofabrik

Live data: Overpass (link to basic explanation)
* use in overpass-turbo / export data (link to basic explanation)
* integrate in website (link to working umap instance)


**Example: buying a new bike

- most places to buy a bicycle are `shop=bicycle`
- however, we need to exclude bicycle repair shops etc. These can be removed: exclude `service:bicycle:retail=no`

- but you can buy bikes at some other places as well. For example, special concepts like "cycle cafés" (`amenity=cafe`, `amenity=pub`), clubs or non-profits, or general sports shops that also sell bicycles
