# CycloFix

A MapComplete mapping tool allowing users to add and/or edit data directly in OpenStreetMap, \
to map, present and integrate cycling infrastructure and relevant points of interest \
(bicycle pumps, repair stations, parking, bike shops, â€¦) \
in the Brussels Capital Region, funded by [Brussels Mobility](https://mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels/en).

It saw the light of day during the 10th edition of [Open Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.be), \
a 4-week summer programme where students, \
coaches and organisations develop innovative libre software.

The mapping tool and all its documentation is hosted on [https://cyclofix.osm.be](https://cyclofix.osm.be). \
Detailed info about MapComplete and other examples can be found on [https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete).
